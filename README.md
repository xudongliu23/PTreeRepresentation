# PTreeRepresentation

- Read a ptree structure from a JSON object, and vice versa.
- Compute the rank of an outcome in a given ptree in a JSON file (NOTE: now assume no empty leaves).
	- e.g., in instances/, instance2.txt describes a ptree with all formulas:
		ptree_instance2.json is the JSON of the tree structure, labeli_instance2.json are the formula labels.
- Compare two outcomes in a given ptree in a JSON file.
